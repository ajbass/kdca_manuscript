Overview:

  - `00-functions.R`: create pathway and data under negative binomial distribution
  - `01-null-setting.R`: null (i.e., no differential co-expression) simulation study (normal distribution)
  - `02-null-setting-nb.R`: null simulation study (negative binomial distribution)
  - `03-null-setting-multivariate.R`: null simulation study (multiple risk factors)
  - `04-alternative-setting.R`: alternative (i.e., differential co-expression) simulation study (one risk factor)
  - `05-alternative-setting-multivariate.R`: alternative (i.e., differential co-expression) simulation study (multiple risk factors)
  - `06-time.R`: time comparisons
  - `07-figures.R`: create manuscript figures
